            <h5>Low Level Assembly Development</h5>
            <p>
              This is a IO Guide for working in low level Assembly and C language with GCC, LD and NASM. Most of the informations are based on various sources but not limited to <a href="wiki.osdev.com">OS DEV Wiki</a>

             <h5>Architecture</h5>
             <p>
               The processor we use in our system comes in various architectures as listed below. Only the most prevalent ones are given here. 
                <ul class="collection">
                <li class="collection-item">i386   / i686          - x86 (32 Bit processors)</li>
                <li class="collection-item">x86_64 / AMD64 / EMT64 - x64 (64 Bit Extensions added to 32Bit processors)      </li>
                <li class="collection-item">ia64                   (64Bit only - Itanium - Not used anymore)       </li>
                <li class="collection-item">ARM </li>
                </ul>
                
                The above information is presented in terms of developer point of view. For eg. __i386__ instruction set is the decade older version of __i686__ instruction set which also becomes obselute. This instruction sets are used in x86 line of processors which is typically 32Bit Processors.  
                <br />
                i386 is compatible with i686 completely and I am using it as its very simple when compared to amd64 or arm instruction set. Later the same concepts can be applied for the newer line x64 line of processors.  
                <br />
                `mov byte  ah,  2`    8  Bit Processors like 8085 mov instruction    
                `mov word  ax,  2`    16 Bit Processors like 8066 mov instruction 
                `mov dword eax, 2`    32 Bit Processors like 80386, 80486, Pentium mov instruction  
                `mov qword rax, 2`    64 Bit processors like i3/i5/i7/Core 2 Duo mov instruction

             <h5>GCC Compiler Suite</h5>
             <p>
               We will be using GCC Compiler Suite to compile our C files to produce the Object files. Normally when we use the default GCC that comes with the system to compile our C Program. Its perfect for programming softrwares that run within the same OS but is limited to only that perticular host in which the program is compiled. <br>
               
               Therefore, we require a special compiler, knows as  <blockquote> GCC Cross Compiler </blockquote> It compiles the program to run on other hosts.
